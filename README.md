# Hangman
A hangman simulation game created using Python and the very basics of web scraping.

How to play ?

1. A word with blanks instead of letters and a hint alluding to the word will be displayed. 
2. If the guessed letter exists in word, all the blanks having that letter in the word will be filled.
<br>For example, if the word is :
<br>_ _ _ _ _
<br> Hint : Fruit; Is said to keep the doctors away
<br>you guess 'p'
<br>Result will be : 
<br>_ p p _ _
3. For every wrong guess, you lose a life.
4. If you lose all the lives (proverbial man is hanged), you lose.
